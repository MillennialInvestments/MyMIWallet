                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>PLEASE READ THIS AFFILIATE PROGRAM AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>This is a contract between you (the “Affiliate”) and us (“Millennial
                            Investments, LLC.”). It describes how we will work together and other aspects
                            of our business relationship. It is a legal document so some of the language is
                            necessarily “legalese”, but we have tried to make it as readable as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The Affiliate Program Agreement applies to your participation in
                            our Affiliate Program (the “Affiliate Program”).  These terms are so
                            important that we cannot have you participate in our Affiliate Program unless
                            you agree to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>We periodically update these terms. We might also choose to
                            replace these terms in their entirety if, for example, the Affiliate Program
                            changes, ends, or becomes part of an existing program, including our partner
                            programs. If we update or replace the terms, we will let you know via
                            electronic means, which may include an in-app notification or by email. If you
                            don’t agree to the update or replacement, you can choose to terminate as we
                            describe below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
