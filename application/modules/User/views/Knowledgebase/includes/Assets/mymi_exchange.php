                                After reaching the Percentage of Limitations and before needing to conduct a Coin Redistribution, Creators also have the option of allowing purchased assets to be exchanged on the MyMI Exchange. 
                                This is an additional revenue stream for the Creator as this allows for them to access additional shared revenue stream in the form of Shared Transactional Fees.

                                Another huge benefit of having MyMI Assets sold on the MyMI Exchange is the price is defined by the value of the Asset Coin on the MyMI Marketplace. 
                                Once that price is defined, Asset Holders (Investors) have the ability to begin obtaining profits by selling all or some of their Percentage of Ownership for any given MyMI Asset.

                                As the asset is exchanged on MyMI Exchange, the price is then determined by the Selling Party until a Buying Party is willing to purchase that share of the assets for that price. 
                                The price that the trade is agreed upon between the Buying &amp; Selling Party then alters the Current Coin Value of the Asset and ultimately determines the Price Evaluation of the Entire Project from that point moving forward.

                                As Asset Holders begin offering their Percentage of Ownership on the MyMI Exchange, transaction fees will be incurred as result of the trade/transactions. 
                                As a reward or utilizing our platform, we provide Creators with a selected percentage of Shared Revenue Streams via <strong>Shared Transactional Fees</strong>.

                                Shared Transactional Fees are accumulated on a Month-by-Month Basis and distribution on the 15th of every month. You gain a percentage of the transactional fees accumulated for any exchange of assets between two Asset Holders.

                                <strong>MyMI Coin</strong> was developed to allow Investors &amp; Partners to conduct purchases of MyMI Assets from the MyMI Exchange and Marketplace(s).

                                In order for Investors/Partners to buy/sell/trade MyMI Assets, they have to purchase MyMI Coin in order to purchase those Assets. 
                                Currently MyMI Gold is the only way for Fiat Conversions, so the Investor/Partner would need to transfer their Current MyMI Gold Holdings into MyMI Coin Assets.

                                MyMI Coin was valued originally at $5,000 overall as a platform and application when we first begin to design/development the platform. 
                                Millennial Investments created 23,000,000 MyMI Coins and offered 115,000,000 MyMI Coins publically to be purchased by interested parties and potential investors. 
                                Within two weeks, we were already reaching our Percentage of Limitations and maxing out the 115,000,000 Available Coins.

                                In order to compensate for a lack of availability for purchasing assets, we conducted our first Coin Redistribution. 
                                In conducting our Coin Redistribution, we released a total 115,000,000 (5x of the Original Amount of Asset Coins available) and disbursed our New Holdings to our Asset Holders. 
                                This simulatenously increased the Market Value (5x) to account for the newly deployed Percentage of Limitations.
