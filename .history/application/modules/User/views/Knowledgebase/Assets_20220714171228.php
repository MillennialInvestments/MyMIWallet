                                                By definition, a <strong>Digital Asset</strong> is classified as anything that is stored digitally and is uniquely identifiable that organizations can use to realize value. 
                                                Examples of digital assets include documents, audio, videos, logos, slide presentations, spreadsheets and websites. 
                                                While becoming more popular throughout the financial markets due to having the ability to disperse ownership of those digital assets.                              
                                            </p>

                                                Perfect example would be <strong>NFTs</strong> for instance. Cryptographic assets have been stored on a blockchain with unique ID Codes and metadata compiled with them that distinguisable between one another. 
                                                NFTs cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency, differing from Fungible Tokens like cryptocurrencies which has the ability to be identical and serve as a medium for commercial transactions.

                                                In order to own assets, you can purchase MyMI Assets from the MyMI Exchange and Marketplace when offered by MyMI Creators. 
                                                You can simply visit the MyMI Marketplace to outright purchase the Assets as long as those Assets are still available for purchase. 
                                                If there are no longer any available assets to be purchased because the initial release of coins were limited to purchase and that purchase limit has been reached, 
                                                you can alternatively purchase those Assets on the MyMI Exchange from other Asset Holders.

                                                By release your asset, you will have the option to identify the <strong>Percentage of Limitation (POI)</strong> of the asset you wish to list. 
                                                The percentage of limitation is the total percentage of available coins that you wish to allocate to the Private/Public Marketplace.

                                                Another huge benefit of having MyMI Assets sold on the MyMI Exchange is the price is defined by the value of the Asset Coin on the MyMI Marketplace. 
                                                Once that price is defined, Asset Holders (Investors) have the ability to begin obtaining profits by selling all or some of their Percentage of Ownership for any given MyMI Asset.

                                                As the asset is exchanged on MyMI Exchange, the price is then determined by the Selling Party until a Buying Party is willing to purchase that share of the assets for that price. 
                                                The price that the trade is agreed upon between the Buying &amp; Selling Party then alters the Current Coin Value of the Asset and ultimately determines the Price Evaluation of the Entire Project from that point moving forward.

                                                As a reward or utilizing our platform, we provide Creators with a selected percentage of Shared Revenue Streams via <strong>Shared Transactional Fees</strong>.

                                                Currently MyMI Gold is the only way for Fiat Conversions, so the Investor/Partner would need to transfer their Current MyMI Gold Holdings into MyMI Coin Assets.

                                                MyMI Coin was the very first asset created, developed and offered to interested investors to obtain Ownership of Assets for the MyMI Platforms and Applications. 
                                                Current Holders are considered as Existing Owners of MyMI Wallet itself. MyMI Coin Holders now have access to Shared Revenue Streams from the platform and it's applications itself.

                                                MyMI Coin was valued originally at $5,000 overall as a platform and application when we first begin to design/development the platform. 
                                                Millennial Investments created 23,000,000 MyMI Coins and offered 115,000,000 MyMI Coins publically to be purchased by interested parties and potential investors. 
                                                Within two weeks, we were already reaching our Percentage of Limitations and maxing out the 115,000,000 Available Coins.

                                            <p class="lead fs-14px">
                                                In order to compensate for a lack of availability for purchasing assets, we conducted our first Coin Redistribution. 
                                                In conducting our Coin Redistribution, we released a total 115,000,000 (5x of the Original Amount of Asset Coins available) and disbursed our New Holdings to our Asset Holders. 
                                                This simulatenously increased the Market Value (5x) to account for the newly deployed Percentage of Limitations.
